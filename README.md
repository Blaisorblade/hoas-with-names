hoas-with-names
===============

Represent functions using higher-order asbtract syntax (HOAS) *using macros to save names*.

To try this out, launch sbt and type the `run` command. This will show the reification of the terms in [`NamedHoasUsage.scala`](NamedHoasUsage.scala), which preserves user-specified names!

If you're curious about the implementation, take a look at [`macros/Macros.scala`](macros/Macros.scala).
